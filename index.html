<p> Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Aine Ekoh and I plan on using this course to gain the skills neccesary for back-end/front development.
     In about six months the aesthetics of this page will be remarkably better than it's presence today. Currently i enjoy learning html, Css,
      Git & Java Script! In my free time i enjoy exercise and eating pizza. I love playing competitive sports such as basketball and volleyball.
      My favorite time of the year is summer. I enjoy the weather during the summer time a long with participating in water sports.

<p> At Texas tech University i graduated in December of 2018 with a bachelors of science in Human development and family studies while minoring in Health professions. 
  I need to make two more paragraphs so i guess i'll discuss the change in weather from Lubbock to Austin. As of recent i only have winter clothese, this is mostly 
because in Lubbock the weather stays around 32-40 degrees celsius.
